# E-Learning
This repository is made for the Navigus recruitment drive where we were assigned a task. 
It is the result of 2 days only. The development is fully based on HTML, CSS, and JS. 
The website will be fully responsive(with window size:360, 720, and 1920)
but for now it for only window size 1920and functions with default username and password which can be seen through pop up box when you click "default login credential" button.
