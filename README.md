# E-Learning
This repository is made for the Navigus recruitment drive where we were assigned a task. It is the result of 2 days only. The development is fully based on HTML, CSS, and JS. The website is fully responsive(with window size:360, 720, and 1920) and functions with default username and password which can be seen through pop-up/alert while loading the login page.
